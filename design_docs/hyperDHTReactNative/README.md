## 🔑 Key Concepts

### The Problem
React Native doesn't provide UDP socket access, which is required by HyperDHT for peer discovery and NAT traversal.

### The Solution
Bare Kit provides a **native runtime** (worklet) that runs alongside React Native with full Node.js compatibility, including UDP socket access.

### The Architecture
```
┌────────────────────┐
│  React Native      │  ← Your UI/UX layer
│  (Hermes/JSC)      │
└─────────┬──────────┘
          │
          │ IPC/RPC (bare-rpc)
          │
┌─────────▼──────────┐
│  Bare Worklet      │  ← Hyperswarm runs here
│  (Native Runtime)  │  ← Has UDP access!
│  ✅ Node.js APIs   │
│  ✅ UDP Sockets    │
│  ✅ Hyperswarm     │
└────────────────────┘
```

### The Trade-offs
- ✅ **Pros**: True P2P, no backend needed, full Hyperswarm functionality
- ⚠️ **Cons**: Larger bundle (~238 MB), more complexity, newer technology
